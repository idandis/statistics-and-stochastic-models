PART 1 

Analysis on a dataset contains daily data on pollutants and meteorological variables from the Arpa Lombardia website, specifically from the Milano Citt√† Studi Pascal monitoring station, and also data on car travel in Milan based on road directions from Cupertino maps. The goal of the analysis was to identify any relationships between ozone presence in the area and other factors using only descriptive statistics (multiple regression, some advanced regression techniques, and nonparametric techniques) with Matlab. 

PART 2 

The project is about analyzing statistical data from the Arpa Lombardia website, which contained a daily collection of atmospheric pollutant quantities and related meteorological variables. Using statistical methods and MATLAB, the goal was to train the predictive capability of the created model using statistical analysis tools and algorithm."
